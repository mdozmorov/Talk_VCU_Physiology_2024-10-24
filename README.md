Dozmorov, Mikhail G., Maggie A. Marshall, Narmeen S. Rashid, Jacqueline M. Grible, Aaron Valentine, Amy L. Olex, Kavita Murthy, et al. “Rewiring of the 3D Genome during Acquisition of Carboplatin Resistance in a Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Patient-Derived Xenograft.” Scientific Reports 13, no. 1 (April 3, 2023): 5420. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32568-7.

With the advancement of sequencing technologies, it is now possible to understand genome's functions beyond the linear scale. I will describe how the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome changes during the development of carboplatin resistance in breast cancer, and which biological functions it affects. We employed chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C), RNA-seq, and whole-genome sequencing to uncover increased short-range interactions, chromatin rewiring and switching to a more active state. Integrative analysis identified amplification of ABC transporters, key cancer-related pathways, and driver transcription factors. The data also suggest that mitochondrial energy metabolism may play critical role in driving chemotherapy resistance.
